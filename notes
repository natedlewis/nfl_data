notes:
- merge game data with injury data for singular object
- create number of games started, and games where snaps meets qualifying snap rate
  # how do players with more snap rates during the back half of a season perform the following season? (ex. David Montgomery)
  # can decreases in snap rates be attributed to corresponding decreasing variables (ex. catch_rate, targets)
- how vital is a tier 1 QB in NW
- find avg. fpts per weighted opportunity
- find complementary QBs to draft
  # could I have done this in the past? What would have been the result using historic adp
  # would need historic projections, or strength of schedule to roughly estimate
  # is it worth investing into two solid comp QBs or one big dawg?
- how do good/bad NW teams perform the last couple weeks?
- how important are 100+ yard games?
  # any preds?
- find 90+ yd games
- how does a good defense affect nw scoring by postiion?
  # I would guess more so in NW because big games are much less likely and floors are hit more often
- make interactive markdown with Shiny framework
